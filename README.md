# Spatial Structure Mapping (SSM)

Spatial Structure Mapping (SSM) is an experimental project focused on aligning 3D structural models with real-world image or video feeds.

The goal is to spatially register a blueprint or reference model to a physical environment, overlaying correctly placed elements and visualizing missing components to support accurate construction and assembly.

This repository currently serves as a foundation for research and prototyping.
